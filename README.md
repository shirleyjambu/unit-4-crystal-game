The Crystal Collector Game

The Crystal Collector game is designed as a fun project using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.

Game Instructions:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. Each crystal would be alloted a certain number of points that would be between 1 - 12.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. The random number would be between
   19 - 120.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add the specific points alloted to the crystal, to the player's total score. 

     * The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When the player clicks a crystal, the player's score counter will be updated.

   * The player wins if the total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if the score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game restarts, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. 

Enjoy the Game !
